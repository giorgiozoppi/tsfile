# Apache IoTDB TsFile Native.
![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/giorgiozoppi/tsfile.svg?branch=dev)


This porting (work in progress) create a library for handling Apache TsFile in embedded devices directly. This for now is just an exercise in C++20, so very incomplete. I plan to work on it deeply in the next 
few weeks.
